  <i>  <h1>The Good Life</h1>
   <b> <p>When some people talk about money
   	      Who went out to buy milk and never
          Came back, and it makes me nostalgic
          For the years I lived on coffee and bread,
          Hungry all the time, walking to work on payday
          Like a woman journeying for water
          From a village without a well, then living
          One or two nights like everyone else
          On roast chicken and red wine.</p>

		  <i><h1>How Bright It Is</h1>
		  <b>
		  <p>April. And the air dry
          As the shoulders of a water buffalo.</p>
          <p>Grasshoppers scratch at the dirt,
          rub their wings with thin legs
          flaring out in front of the soldiers
          in low arcing flights, wings a blur.</p>
          <p>The soldiers don’t notice anymore,
          seeing only the wreckage of the streets,
          bodies draped with sheets, and the sun,
          how bright it is, how hard and flat and white.</p>
          <p>It will take many nails from the coffinmakers
          to shut out this light, which reflects off everything:
          the calloused feet of the dead, their bony hands, 
          their pale foreheads so cold, brilliant in the sun.</p>

		  <i><h1>The Farewell</h1>
		  <b><p>They say the ice will hold
          so there I go,
          forced to believe them by my act of trusting people,
          stepping out on it,</p>
          <p>and naturally it gaps open
          and I, forced to carry on coolly
          by my act of being imperturbable,
          slide erectly into the water wearing my captain's helmet,
          waving to the shore with a sad smile,
          "Goodbye my darlings, goodbye dear one,"
          as the ice meets again over my head with a click.</p>
